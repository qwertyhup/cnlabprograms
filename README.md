# VTU Computer Networks Lab Programs

This repo contains the programs for computer networks lab subject (5th semester, CSE). It has all the 12 programs prescribed by VTU and all are tested. Contains only the source code and no compiled files are avaiable. 

The first six simulation programs should be run with ns2 network simulator software. The other 6 programs are implemented in java and they should be compiled.

The programs are not documented. If anyone is interested in documenting these programs, please open a pull request after documenting it or message me.
